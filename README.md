# Monty Project

## Description

This project is an interpreter for Monty ByteCode files. Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that uses a stack and provides specific instructions to manipulate it. The interpreter reads bytecode files and executes the appropriate operations on a stack.

## Requirements

- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89`.
- All files should end with a new line.
- Code must follow the Betty style.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- You are allowed to use the C standard library.
- A README.md file at the root of the project is mandatory.
- Use a maximum of one global variable.

## Compilation

To compile the project, run:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
# DataViz-Explorer
# monty
